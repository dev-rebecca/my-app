Comment on each of the 3rd party frameworks used, why was it chosen

- I'm using React as my third party framework, because React is very popular in the feild and therefore I would like to learn it.

What other technologies did you investigate in order to settle on a path

- I looked into nextJS, Laravel and Symfony however I decided to stick with React as it was the most popular.

# How to Configure ✨ 

1. Pull both the "wildlife-watcher" and "ws" repositories onto your device. The "wildlife-watcher" folder needs to sit in your localhost directory.
2. Import the "wildlife-watcher.sql" database into MySQL. Set up access with your own username and password.
3. Configure the "connection.php" file in the "ws" folder; with your own desired port, username and password.
4. In your terminal within "wildlife-watcher", run "npm update" to install all required packages. 
5. The app should be functional! Either register your own account or use the following to login for some preset information:

    email: bob@gmail.com
    password: Password!1

Happy wildlife watching!

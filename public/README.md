# How to Configure âœ¨ 

1. Import database
2. Configure imported database with the following settings, or alter settings in db.php:

    $dbURI = 'mysql:host=localhost;port=8889;dbname=wildlife-watcher';
    $dbconn = new PDO($dbURI, 'user1', 'user1');

3. The app should be functional. Either register your own account or use the following to login:

Note for John: As I am working on the app everyday, I wouldn't be surprised if some curls possibly fail by the time you run your tests. Let me know.
